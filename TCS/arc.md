Letâ€™s clarify your question to ensure precision.

You mentioned a **path across the top face** of a cube from:

* **(0, 0, 10)** â†’ **(10, 0, 10)** â†’ **(10, 10, 10)**

These are **straight-line segments** along the **edges of the cube's top face**â€”not arcs on a circular surface.

### âœ… Path Type:

This is **not an arc** â€” it's a **linear path along the cube edges**. Each leg is **10 cm**, so:

* First leg: from (0, 0, 10) to (10, 0, 10) â†’ 10 cm
* Second leg: from (10, 0, 10) to (10, 10, 10) â†’ 10 cm
* **Total path length**: 10 + 10 = **20 cm**

### ðŸš« Ï€/6 (Pi by 6)?

* **Ï€/6 radians = 30 degrees**.
* That only applies when discussing **angles on a circle or arc**, not **edge-based linear distances on a cube**.
* So unless you're referring to a **curved path**, **Ï€/6 has no relevance here**.

Would you like to discuss a curved (arc) path instead â€” like wrapping around a corner or moving along a sphere?
