This is a classic **unfolding surface geometry problem** that tests spatial reasoning and application of cylindrical geometry.

Let‚Äôs break it down and walk through a plan to solve it.

## üß† **Understanding the Problem Setup**

You are given:

* A vertical **cylinder** (cistern) of height `h`, radius `r`.
* The **top surface** is a circle; the **curved surface** is a vertical side.
* A **bug** starts at point `A`, located a distance `s` from the top edge, directly below point `B` (on the top rim of the cylinder).

We define:

* For any point on **curved surface**: coordinate is **(t, p)** where:

  * `t = vertical distance from the top`,
  * `p = angle (in degrees) from the bug‚Äôs topmost point B to the destination point on the rim`.
* For any point on **top surface**: coordinate is **(-a, q)** where:

  * `a = distance from center E`,
  * `q = angle from EB (the radius from center to top point B)`.

## üß≠ Objective

Given:

* The **starting point** A is at `(s, 0)` on the curved surface.
* The **destination point** is `(t, p)` (curved) or `(-a, q)` (top).
* Compute the **shortest distance** the bug can travel along the surface.

## üìê Step-by-Step Plan

We handle two cases based on the destination coordinate type:

---

### **Case 1: Destination on Curved Surface ‚Üí Coordinate (t, p)**

The curved surface can be **unwrapped** as a rectangle of:

* **Height = h**
* **Width = 2œÄr**

On this rectangle:

* Angle `p` maps to a horizontal distance = `p * œÄ * r / 180`
* Distance between `(s, 0)` and `(t, p)` becomes Euclidean:

$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(s - t)^2 + \left(\frac{\pi r p}{180}\right)^2}
$$

---

### **Case 2: Destination on Top Surface ‚Üí Coordinate (-a, q)**

Now, this is trickier because you may:

* Climb vertically from point A to the top (distance = `s`)
* Then walk on the **circular top surface**

From point B (bug‚Äôs nearest point on top), go to `(‚àía, q)`:

* It is at distance `a` from center, and angle `q`
* Use **Law of Cosines** in circle to get distance from B to destination:

Let‚Äôs denote:

* EB = r (from center to B)
* EF = a (from center to destination)
* ‚à†BEF = q degrees

Then:

$$
\text{Distance on top} = \sqrt{r^2 + a^2 - 2ra \cos(\theta)}
\quad \text{where } \theta = \frac{q \pi}{180}
$$

So total distance = `s` (vertical) + circular distance from B to destination.

## üîÅ Recap

| Destination Type | Coordinates | Path                                |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Curved surface   | `(t, p)`    | Unwrap ‚Üí Rectangular path (t, p)    |
| Top surface      | `(-a, q)`   | Go up s, then circle law of cosines |
