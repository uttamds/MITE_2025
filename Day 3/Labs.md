## 1
Given a list of integers, remove all duplicate elements and return a sorted list of the unique numbers.

Input: [4, 2, 5, 2, 3, 4, 1]  
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


Hint: Use a set to remove duplicates and sorted() to sort.

## 2

Given a string of words separated by spaces, return a dictionary where each key is a word and its value is the count of that word in the string.

Input: "apple banana apple orange banana apple"  
Output: {'apple': 3, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 1}

Hint: Use .split() and a dictionary to count.

## 3

Write a function that checks whether two given lists have no elements in common (i.e., they are disjoint).

Input: [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]  
Output: True

Input: [1, 2, 3], [3, 4, 5]  
Output: False

Hint: Use sets and set intersection.
